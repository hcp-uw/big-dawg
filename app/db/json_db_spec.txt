NOT FOR FRONT END!!! GTFO, implementation details not for u :)

We will use types from Types.ts and implement the db interface with JSON_DB class.

We will store our data across several json files. 

For each month we will have a json file with the workout history for that month and when a function such as getWorkout()
or GetCalendarView is called we will simply store the entire month in a cache (ie memory). This is since users are likely to not
get data from different months

Feb2025.json:
    [
        {
            Date: String; // feb 1st
            TimeStarted : bigint;
            TimeEnded : bigint;
            Sets : Set[];
            WorkoutComment : string
        };
        ...
        {
            Date: String; //feb 28th
            TimeStarted : bigint;
            TimeEnded : bigint;
            Sets : Set[];
            WorkoutComment : string
        };
    ]

For each exercise we will also have a file which will store both info abt exercise and the exercise history
Note: maybe we will change this to make getExerciseList() faster idk

Squat.json
    {
        Exercise_Name : string;
        Muscle_Group : Muscle_Group; 
        Comment : string;
        Hist = Set[]
    }
